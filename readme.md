# Viz Media Archiver

This was written for personal use as a way to archive digital goods acquired through the Viz Media app.

This isn't feature complete, and requires an active subscription to Viz to work. It'll also require manually pulling IDs for the manga series you're reading to work.

I might one day try and find a way to "search" for a series and return its ID, or work with your favourites. But, that seems to be controlled through Firebase, which will require a bit more work than I'm willing to put in at the time of releasing this repo.

I don't recommend others use this project. This was written as an experiment to poke around undocumented APIs and work with Golang. I have no idea how Viz would/will respond to this, but I'm willing to take that personal risk.
