# Viz Media Archiver

This was written for personal use as a way to archive digital goods acquired through the Viz Media app.

**This isn't feature complete, and requires an active subscription to Viz/Shonen Jump to work.**

## Series list (`series-list.json`)
The `series-list.json` file was naively generated by iterating through ids 1..1000, and _should_ represent a list of all the manga available on Viz/Shonen Jump.

There are explicit `time.Sleep` calls to avoid
1. being rate limited and
2. hammering their servers for no reason and being a bad actor

The functionality exists in `main.go` to regenerate this list (and could be re-run if you come across a series in the app that is not in the list). But, I'd **strongly recommend** not running it often. And if/when you do run it, you're doing it at your own risk!

## Warnings
I don't recommend others use this project. This was written as an experiment to poke around undocumented APIs and work with Golang. I have no idea how Viz/Shonen Jump would/will respond to this, and could result in an account/personal ban for anyone who uses it.
